# What is TypeScript?

this repository contains the code and concepts that I used to get started with TypeScript. 

<hr>

you can convert the `.ts` files to `.js` using the following command:
```bash 
tsc file_name.ts
# Initializes a watcher process that will keep main.js up to date.
tsc file_name.ts --watch
```
